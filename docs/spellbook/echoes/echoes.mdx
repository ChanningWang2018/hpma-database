# Echoes

## Basic Information

Every Echo has a unique ability that synergizes differently depending on the Deck it is assigned.

## Equipping an Echo

Assigning an Echo to a Deck can aid you in combat with its unique ability while also providing a Health and Attack bonus. Echoes can also grant Extra Level Bonuses when the Echo Bonus Card is the same as the current Card.
